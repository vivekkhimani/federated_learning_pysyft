# Implementing Federated Learning using PySyft

### Basics:
- Dataset - MNIST
- Number of Workers - 32
- Classification Model - CNN (see the details in models directory)
- Tools Used - PySyft, PyTorch

### Instructions:
- Prerequisite: python3, pip3, pysyft, pytorch
- RUN: "main_fed.py"
- To edit the basic characteristics of the model, check "/utils/Arguments.py". No CLI has been provided for now. 
- To edit the classification model, check "/models/CNN.py"


### Future Work:
- Add a CLI to make the process of editing the arguments easier. 
- Facilitate training by selecting a subset of workers instead of using all the workers.
